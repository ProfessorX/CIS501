## Introduction ##
Yet another project hosting. Well, they say git is the future, who the
heck knows. (All in all, Emacs is so damn powerful.)
Right now I would post news of project progress here.

## Course Project ##

### Preprocessing ###
* Consider missing categorical values as a separate value.
* Calculate the mean of features to impute missing values.
* Add an extra indicator to indicate missingness (if possible. 1 for
  missing and 0 for not-missing.)

## Course Presentation ##
I suppose I can add a few more slides, about the technical background
of that paper. AKA, some mathematical stuff.

* The result is already there. So all I need to add
1. Some regular expressions.
2. Some basic math skills and techniques when dealing data mining
problems like this.
3. That should suffice. And pickup what should be interesting for
them, and share your "fun" with them

### Notes ###
Below are some notes by Dr. Woon.
The main thing is that:
    * transparency and clarity of the methodology
    * creativity in using different things and tools, but reasonable ones
    * show the efforts that spent for the project


## TODO ##
1. Finish the modification of your presentation slides, within
   today. The today is defined as, November 27th.

## Introduction ##
Yet another project hosting. Well, they say git is the future, who the
heck knows. (All in all, Emacs is so damn powerful.)
Right now I would post news of project progress here.

## Course Project ##

### Preprocessing ###
* Consider missing categorical values as a separate value.
* Calculate the mean of features to impute missing values.
* Add an extra indicator to indicate missingness (if possible. 1 for
  missing and 0 for not-missing.)

### Some Urgent Stuff ###
Plan to backup or rescue this project, with the help of some packages
mentioned in IBM Research paper. (Well, I have to do this since I am
the team leader.)

### Possible Running ###
weka.classifiers.meta.EnsembleSelection -W /home/abrahamx91/Masdar-Institute/Data-Mining/Project/Train -P rmse -A library -B 10 -V 0.25 -E 0.5 -H 100 -I 1.0 -X 1 -R -G -S 1

## Course Presentation ##
I suppose I can add a few more slides, about the technical background
of that paper. AKA, some mathematical stuff.

* The result is already there. So all I need to add
1. Some regular expressions.
2. Some basic math skills and techniques when dealing data mining
problems like this.
3. That should suffice. And pickup what should be interesting for
them, and share your "fun" with them

### Notes ###
Below are some notes by Dr. Woon.
The main thing is that:
    * transparency and clarity of the methodology
    * creativity in using different things and tools, but reasonable ones
    * show the efforts that spent for the project


## TODO ##
    1. Finish the modification of your presentation slides, within
    today. The today is defined as, November 27th.

    20131128 Lab 17:17
        1. Finish the Introduction part and the second section. Within today.
        2. Review what I have written.

    20131202 Lab 23:30
        1. You either work hard enough to keep your seat here. Or pack
           all your belongings and fuck yourself off to People's
           Republic.
        2. For data mining presentation:
           * Regular expressions in Histrace (add the missing stuff,
             by way of {block} and {verbatim}). Well, I did use this
             technique before, somehow I forgot to use for the former
             presentation.
           * Add the missing IR technique descriptions.
           * Possible applications? (I do not think so. Right now I
             prefer to talk more about RegEx and some IR techniques
             they used. Since their results, is funny.)
    
    20131203 Lab 13:00
        1. Figure out how to manipulate those packages.
        2. Write shell scripts to test those fucking stuff.
        3. Run those stuff on your workstation.
        4. A simple note: 16:00 Group meeting with your RESEARCH
           partners. You have to make a hit, here.
